- **Third-Party Transcription Service (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text)**
  - Send Audio Data via API
  - Receive Transcribed Text

#### AI Model Processing (NLP, Predictions)
- **Third-Party AI Services (e.g., IBM Watson, OpenAI)**
  - Send Text/Data for Analysis via API
  - Receive AI-processed Results

#### Text-to-Speech Conversion
- **Third-Party Text-to-Speech Service (e.g., Amazon Polly)**
  - Send Text Data via API
  - Receive Speech Audio

#### Load Balancing and Traffic Management
- **Cloud-Based Load Balancer (e.g., AWS ELB, Cloudflare)**
  - Distribute Incoming API Requests

#### Data Storage and Management
- **Cloud Database Service (e.g., AWS RDS, MongoDB Atlas)**
  - Store and Retrieve Data via API

#### File Storage System
